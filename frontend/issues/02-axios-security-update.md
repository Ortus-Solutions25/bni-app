# Fix Axios DoS Vulnerability

## Objective
Update axios to version 1.12.0 or higher to resolve the critical Denial of Service vulnerability affecting versions below 1.12.0.

## Context
The current axios version (1.11.0) contains a DoS vulnerability that could allow attackers to cause service disruption through malformed requests. This is a **HIGH SEVERITY** vulnerability that requires immediate attention.

**Current Version:** axios@1.11.0
**Required Version:** axios@1.12.0+
**Vulnerability Type:** Denial of Service (DoS)

## Tasks
- [ ] Update axios to latest secure version
- [ ] Verify API calls still function correctly
- [ ] Test file upload functionality (uses axios)
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Ensure no breaking changes in axios API usage
- [ ] Run comprehensive application tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] axios version is 1.12.0 or higher
- [ ] All existing API functionality works correctly
- [ ] File upload/download operations function properly
- [ ] Authentication and authorization work as expected
- [ ] No console errors related to axios changes
- [ ] Application builds and runs successfully

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update Axios Version
```bash
cd frontend
npm update axios
```

### 2. Verify Update
```bash
npm list axios
```

### 3. Test Critical API Functions
Test these key areas that use axios:
- Chapter data loading
- Member data operations
- File upload functionality
- Authentication requests
- Report generation

### 4. Check for Breaking Changes
Review axios changelog and test:
- Request/response interceptors
- Error handling patterns
- Configuration options
- TypeScript definitions

### 5. Run Application Tests
```bash
npm test
npm run build
npm start
```

## Files to Modify/Create
- `package.json` (version update)
- `package-lock.json` (automatic update)

## Git Workflow
```bash
git checkout -b security/fix-axios-dos-vulnerability
npm update axios
# Test application thoroughly
npm test
npm run build
npm start
# Verify no regressions in functionality
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "security: update axios to fix DoS vulnerability

- Update axios from 1.11.0 to latest secure version (1.12.0+)
- Resolves high severity DoS vulnerability in axios < 1.12.0
- Maintain all existing API functionality and error handling
- Verify file upload, authentication, and data loading work correctly

Fixes critical security vulnerability CVE reference for axios DoS"
git push origin security/fix-axios-dos-vulnerability
```

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Verify axios version
npm list axios

# Test application functionality
npm test
npm run build
npm start

# Manual testing checklist:
# 1. Login/authentication flows
# 2. Chapter dashboard loading
# 3. Member data operations
# 4. File upload functionality
# 5. Report generation
# 6. Error handling for network failures
```

## Success Metrics
- [ ] `npm audit --audit-level high` shows reduced vulnerability count
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] File upload/download functionality works
- [ ] Authentication flows complete successfully
- [ ] No regression in application performance
- [ ] No new console errors or warnings

## Notes
- This is a dependency update that should be backward compatible
- Focus testing on areas that heavily use HTTP requests
- Monitor for any changes in error message formats
- Consider updating axios usage patterns if new features are available
- Document any configuration changes needed for the new version
