I want to have the following;

I can go ahead and click into any of the chapters.

in these chapters I see a drop down of all previously added months data. It allows me to select this range and then shows me the matrices from it etc.

It also now allows me to upload new data and set its current month.

The final tab will show me all of the members in teh chapter. it will show their growth or decline from the previous month. if ther is only one months data then it doesnt show the growth/decline labels.

What all data we actually need:

- chapter name
- reports that were generated for the month that are needed for comparission or loading matrices.
- member names
- all data that we pull out of the slip audit reports - referal matrix, oto matrix, combination matrix, tyfcb inside and a=outside chapter etc.

remember we need all this data because if we click on one of the members, it should show me all their details!

We also want to make sure that we have a way to delete previously inputted data. dont make it super hard. just we can delete it from a dataset management page. on the same page we have an upload option that lets us input our slip audit reports and emmber name to generate a new set.

ask me any clarifying qwuerstions
